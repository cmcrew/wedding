<h1>Courtney and Kim's Wedding Website</h1>

Kim and I are getting married this July, and we decided to opt for a digital invitation rather than a paper one. This is a collaborative project between the two of us, as well as my midterm and final project for my Front End Web Dev class at GA NYC.

When finished, the site will be a long scrolling parallax site with a link at the end to an RSVP form (still to be developed).
